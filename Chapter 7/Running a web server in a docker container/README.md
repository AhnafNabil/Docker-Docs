# Running an NGINX Web Server in a Docker Container

## Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run an NGINX web server inside a Docker container. NGINX is a powerful web server and reverse proxy that is widely used for serving static content, load balancing, and more. Docker is a platform that allows you to easily create, deploy, and run applications in containers. By combining NGINX with Docker, you can achieve a highly portable and easily maintainable web server setup.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Docker: Follow the official [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.
- Basic knowledge of command line operations.

## Steps to Run NGINX in a Docker Container

### 1. Pull the NGINX Docker Image

First, you need to pull the NGINX image from Docker Hub. Open your terminal and run:

```sh
docker pull nginx
```

This command downloads the latest NGINX image from the official Docker repository.

### 2. Create a Directory for NGINX Content

Create a directory on your host system to hold the NGINX configuration files and web content. For example:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/nginx/html
```

### 3. Create a Simple HTML File

Create a simple HTML file to be served by the NGINX web server. In your terminal, run:

```sh
echo "<h1>Hello, Docker!</h1>" > ~/nginx/html/index.html
```

### 4. Run the NGINX Container

Run the NGINX container, mapping the local directory to the containerâ€™s web root. Use the following command:

```sh
docker run --name my-nginx -v ~/nginx/html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -p 8080:80 -d nginx
```

Explanation of the command options:

- `--name my-nginx`: Names the container "my-nginx".
- `-v ~/nginx/html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro`: Maps the local `~/nginx/html` directory to the container's `/usr/share/nginx/html` directory in read-only mode.
- `-p 8080:80`: Maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container.
- `-d nginx`: Runs the NGINX container in detached mode.

### 5. Verify the NGINX Server

To verify that the NGINX server is running, open a web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You should see the "Hello, Docker!" message.

## Managing the NGINX Container

### Stopping the Container

To stop the running NGINX container, use the command:

```sh
docker stop my-nginx
```

### Starting the Container

To start the stopped container, use:

```sh
docker start my-nginx
```

### Removing the Container

To remove the NGINX container, first ensure it is stopped:

```sh
docker stop my-nginx
```

Then remove the container:

```sh
docker rm my-nginx
```

### Viewing Container Logs

To view the logs of the NGINX container, use:

```sh
docker logs my-nginx
```

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you have successfully set up and run an NGINX web server inside a Docker container. This setup allows for easy deployment and management of your web server. You can further customize and scale this setup based on your specific requirements.
