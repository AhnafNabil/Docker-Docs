## Using Read-Only File Systems in Docker Containers

Using read-only file systems in Docker containers enhances security and stability. By preventing changes to the files within a container, you can ensure a consistent environment and protect against file system tampering. This document outlines the steps to set up a read-only WordPress container and addresses common issues that may arise.

### Benefits of Read-Only File Systems

1. **Consistency**: The container remains unchanged, ensuring a consistent environment across different deployments.
2. **Security**: Protects the container from unauthorized changes, reducing the risk of malicious modifications.

### Setting Up a Read-Only WordPress Container

1. **Create and Start the WordPress Container**:
    ```sh
    docker run -d --name wp --read-only wordpress:4
    ```

2. **Verify the Container is Running**:
    ```sh
    docker inspect --format "{{.State.Running}}" wp
    ```
    This command will print `true` if the container is running and `false` otherwise.

3. **Check Container Logs**:
    If the container isn't running, inspect the logs to identify the issue:
    ```sh
    docker logs wp
    ```
    You may see an error like:
    ```
    error: missing WORDPRESS_DB_HOST and MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP environment variables
    ```

4. **Set Up MySQL Database Container**:
    ```sh
    docker run -d --name wpdb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=ch2demo mysql:5
    ```

5. **Link WordPress to the MySQL Container**:
    ```sh
    docker run -d --name wp2 --link wpdb:mysql -p 80 --read-only wordpress:4
    ```

6. **Verify the New Container is Running**:
    ```sh
    docker inspect --format "{{.State.Running}}" wp2
    ```

### Handling Write Requirements in Read-Only Containers

If the WordPress container fails to start due to write requirements, you may see errors like:
```
Read-only file system: AH00023: Couldn't create the rewrite-map mutex (file /var/lock/apache2/rewrite-map.1)
```

To resolve this, use volumes to provide writable paths for specific directories:
```sh
docker run -d --name wp3 --link wpdb:mysql -p 80 \
    -v /run/lock/apache2/ \
    -v /run/apache2/ \
    --read-only wordpress:4
```

### Considerations

While using a read-only file system increases security and consistency, certain applications (like WordPress) may require write access to specific directories for functionality. Address this by mounting writable volumes where necessary.

### Future Improvements

- **Separate Database Hosting**: Consider running the database on a separate host or using a managed database service to enhance scalability and reliability.
- **Environment Variables for Configuration**: Use environment variables to configure important settings such as database credentials and salts. This approach simplifies the provisioning process and avoids creating multiple versions of the WordPress image for different configurations.

By following these guidelines, you can deploy a stable and secure WordPress container using a read-only file system while accommodating necessary write exceptions.
